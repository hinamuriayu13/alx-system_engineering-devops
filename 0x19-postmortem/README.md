### Postmortem: Apache 500 Internal Server Error

#### Issue Summary
- **Duration:** June 21, 2024, 14:00 UTC to June 21, 2024, 15:00 UTC
- **Impact:** The primary web service hosted on Apache was returning a 500 Internal Server Error. Users were unable to access the website, impacting 100% of the user base during the outage.
- **Root Cause:** A misnamed PHP file extension in the 'wp-settings.php' file.

#### Timeline

- **14:00 UTC:** Issue detected via monitoring alert indicating multiple 500 errors.
- **14:05 UTC:** Initial investigation began. Logs reviewed, showing PHP errors.
- **14:15 UTC:** Assumed root cause was a missing PHP module. Attempted to reinstall PHP modules.
- **14:25 UTC:** Reinstallation had no effect. Further log analysis initiated.
- **14:35 UTC:** Escalated to the learner for additional insights.
- **14:40 UTC:** Learner identified a misnamed file through `strace` output.
- **14:45 UTC:** Renamed the file from "wp-settings.phpp" to "wp-settings.php".
- **14:50 UTC:** Apache service restarted, confirming resolution.
- **15:00 UTC:** Issue fully resolved, normal service restored.

#### Root Cause and Resolution
- **Detailed Cause:** The root cause of the outage was a misnamed PHP file within the web directory. Specifically, "wp-settings.phpp" instead of "wp-settings.php". This caused Apache to fail to process the file correctly, resulting in a 500 Internal Server Error.
- **Detailed Resolution:** The issue was resolved by renaming the file from "wp-settings.phpp" to "wp-settings.php". After the file was renamed, the Apache server was restarted to apply the changes, and the service was restored.

#### Corrective and Preventative Measures
- **Improvements Needed:**
  - Implement a file extension validation check in the deployment pipeline.
  - Enhance monitoring to detect such file misconfigurations automatically.
  - Conduct regular training sessions to reduce human error in file handling.

- **Tasks to Address the Issue:**
  1. **Patch Nginx Server:** Ensure it checks file extensions before processing.
  2. **Add Monitoring on Server Memory:** Enhance monitoring to include checks for correct file extensions.
  3. **Implement Automated Script:** Create a script to validate all PHP files in the repository before deployment.
  4. **Deploy CI/CD Enhancements:** Integrate file validation checks within the CI/CD pipeline.
  5. **Conduct Training:** Organize a training session on common deployment errors and best practices for all engineers.
