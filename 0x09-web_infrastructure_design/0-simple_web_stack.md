- Infrastructure Description :

	This setup comprises a basic web infrastructure housing a website accessible through www.foobar.com. Without any firewalls or SSL certificates safeguarding the server's network, each component, such as the database and application server, must utilize the server's shared resources of CPU, RAM, and SSD.

- About This Infrastructure :

	    Server Definition: A server, whether hardware or software, serves other computers, often called clients, by providing various services.
    Domain Name Purpose: Domain names offer user-friendly substitutes for IP Addresses, like how www.wikipedia.org is easier to recall than 91.198.174.192. The mapping between IP addresses and domain names is handled by the Domain Name System (DNS).
    DNS Record for www.foobar.com: www.foobar.com utilizes an A record, identifiable through the command "dig www.foobar.com." In this design, an A record is employed for the infrastructure.
    Web Server's Role: Acting as software or hardware, the web server responds to HTTP or HTTPS requests by delivering requested content or error messages.
    Application Server's Role: Application servers handle the installation, operation, and hosting of applications and their associated services, facilitating the delivery of consumer or business applications.
    Database's Role: Databases maintain organized collections of information, allowing for easy access, management, and updates.
    Server-Client Communication: Communication between the server and the client's computer occurs over the internet network, utilizing the TCP/IP protocol suite.
